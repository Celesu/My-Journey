This is my SQL stuffs that has been done on POSTGRE. I got the cases from a website, which you can reach from [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/). I may going to add more if I've clear more study cases. 

Note: Please use this as a guide, not as a cheating object, since it's more fun to solve problems by yourself and learn by doing :)
